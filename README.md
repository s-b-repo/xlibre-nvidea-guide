# xlibre-nvidea-guide-installation 

Here‚Äôs a comprehensive guide to installing **XLibre** (a fork of Xorg) alongside proprietary NVIDIA drivers, tailored for an advanced Linux user like yourself:

---

## 1. üß† What is XLibre?

* XLibre is a recent fork of Xorg by Enrico‚ÄØWeigelt (responsible for \~63% of recent Xorg commits) ([x.com][1]).
* It includes cleanups, ABI changes, but may break compatibility‚Äîmany Xorg drivers work, but proprietary NVIDIA often **requires recompiling** ([linuxiac.com][2]).
* It‚Äôs still early-stage: first releases expected in **late June 2025**, driver compatibility being a key focus ([reddit.com][3]).

---

## 2. ‚öôÔ∏è System Preparation

Ensure your system meets these prerequisites:

1. **Build tools + dev headers**

   ```
   sudo apt-get install build-essential git meson ninja pkg-config libx11-dev libxcb1-dev libxrandr-dev libxrender-dev libxinerama-dev libxext-dev xutils-dev libpciaccess-dev
   ```

2. **NVIDIA driver and CUDA toolkit** (optional, but driver sources required)

3. **Remove conficting Xorg** if using same module names

   ```
   sudo apt remove --purge xserver-xorg-core xserver-xorg
   ```

---

## 3. üì¶ Obtaining XLibre

Clone the development repo:

```
git clone https://github.com/X11Libre/xserver.git xlibre
cd xlibre
```

You‚Äôll see many code cleanup commits and changed module ABIs ([github.com][4], [reddit.com][5]).

---

## 4. üîß Build & Install XLibre

```
meson setup builddir
ninja -C builddir
sudo ninja -C builddir install
```

‚ö†Ô∏è The X server will install (e.g.) `/usr/bin/X`. You may want to install to a custom prefix to avoid conflict.

---

## 5. üîÑ Recompile NVIDIA Driver

Because XLibre changed ABIs, proprietary NVIDIA must be rebuilt:

1. Download the official `.run` installer from NVIDIA.
2. Make it executable:

   ```
   chmod +x NVIDIA-Linux-*.run
   sudo sh ./NVIDIA-Linux-*.run --kernel-name=$(uname -r)
   ```

   This rebuilds the kernel module and X driver dynamically.

Alternatively, use your distro‚Äôs DKMS packages adjusted to XLibre headers.

---

## 6. üß™ Testing & Troubleshooting

* Start X via `startx` or a display manager.
* Check logs in `/var/log/Xorg.0.log` (or with XLibre, whichever log you configured).
* Watch for dynamic library mismatches or ABI errors.
* If X crashes/no input, you'll need fallback (e.g., SSH with `chvt 1` on a timer) ([reddit.com][5], [forum.zorin.com][6], [news.ycombinator.com][7], [github.com][4]).

---

## 7. üß© If You‚Äôre Using Arch (AUR)

You can use the **`xlibre-server-git` AUR package**, which provides development builds ([aur.archlinux.org][8]):

```
git clone https://aur.archlinux.org/xlibre-server-git.git
cd xlibre-server-git
makepkg -si
```

Then recompile/install the NVIDIA driver via `pacman`, DKMS, or `.run`.

---

## 8. ‚úÖ Final Steps

* Reboot to load new kernel modules.
* Run:

  ```
  lsmod | grep nvidia
  nvidia-smi
  xrandr
  xlibre --version  # if supported
  ```
* Ensure no nouveau driver conflicts.

---

## 9. ‚ö†Ô∏è Caveats & Caveats

* Still early days: community concerns over code stability ([news.ycombinator.com][7]).
* Proprietary NVIDIA compatibility is "work-in-progress", with no promises yet .
* Only experienced users should attempt this; it‚Äôs mainly for developers or pentesters comfortable with low-level graphics stack changes.

---

## üìÖ Timeline

* **June 7, 2025** ‚Äì XLibre announced ([aur.archlinux.org][8], [linuxiac.com][2])
* **Late June 2025** ‚Äì First official XLibre release expected&#x20;

---

## üîê Summary 

1. Install prerequisites.
2. Clone & build XLibre.
3. Remove conflicting Xorg.
4. Rebuild proprietary NVIDIA driver.
5. Test, tweak, and debug through logs.
6. For Arch, use AUR.
7. Keep track of ongoing compatibility updates.
